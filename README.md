## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first web page designed with css.I learned the basics of flex-box and html tags.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
html body {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

After learning basic html and css as w3schools, I am learning Bootstrap 5 and want to do this project without building custom css.

### Useful resources

- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me for getting basics of html and css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This is site that gives all the answers a coder faces in the daily development life.
