## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BootStrap 5
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned to build a basic page withe HTML, CSS and bootstrap 5. I have not used JavaScript so that i could learn more about bootstrap classes.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 400px) {
  -Customization for mobile screens
}
```

### Continued development

In the next challange I will use JavaScript and dig more into bootstrap 5.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) - I learned all the CSS and bootstrap 5 from here and answered all the quizes and exercises.
- [Bootstrap Official Site](https://getbootstrap.com) - I took the reference about the class to be used.
- [Mobile Custom Menus](https://dev.to/codeply/bootstrap-5-sidebar-examples-38pb) - I took the example from this side to create curtain menu.
